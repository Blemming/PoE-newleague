### Tips
	- Logging out to the Character Selection screen and back in is a great way to go back to town for free (risky for the first hour of the league)
	- You don't need to talk to NPCs to get quests
	- One Man tag: Hit boss with everyone not in instance, port in, easy 1 man boss
	- Skitter bots slow mobs and shock(15%damage)
	- Leaving Izaro lieutenants alive gives you more keys at the end
	- At level 50 and over, do all vaal side areas for 6-links, you can change colors in crafting bench
	- Don't obsess over every drop, prioritize sockets and links
	- 7 vaal gems + sacrifice fragment = Vaal orb, with Vaal Orbs you can vaal your skills
	- Molten shell is a very good skill to vaal
	- Essences are good for easy leveling crafting
	- Sell to the vendor a Rustic Sash (magic or rare) + Blacksmith Whetstone + weapon = Magic same weapon type with (40 to 64%) Increased Physical Damage
	- Sell to the vendor a Chain Belt (magix or rare) + Blacksmith Whetstone + Dagger/Sceptre/Staff/Wand = Magic  same weapon with (10 to 29%) Increased Spell Damage
	- Sell to a vendor Magic Sceptre/Wand/Rune Dagger + Ruby Ring(for Fire Damage) or Topaz Ring(for Lightning Damage) or Sapphire Ring(for Cold Damage) + Orb of Alteration = Weapon with with added x to x Lightning/Fire/Cold Damage to Spells
	- Sell to a vendor White Boots + Any rarity Quicksilver Flask + Orb of Augmentation = Magic Boots with 10% increased Movement Speed
	- Sell to a vendor Magic or Rare Boots with +X% Movement Speed + Any rarity Quicksilver Flask + Orb of Augmentation = Magic Boots with (original value)+5% increased Movement Speed


## --=== Act 1 ===--
### Tips
	- There's a crafting recipe after Brutus, but it is not worth picking up
	- Look for 3-link wands at vendor and +1 skill gem type you are using
	- Look for movement speed boots at vendor by using the search function, searching 'nn', thanks to /u/Door2doorcalgary for bring this up
	- Pick up all small blues to vendor for alteration shards
	- Wait until level ~10-12 for league mechanics
	- Don't use chest armor, chest armor slow your movement speed
	- Tri-color tri-link gives you a chromatic orb when sold to vendor
	- It is worth killing blue mobs groups early, but not rare mobs as they give little experience compared to the time it takes to kill
	- Frostblink is better than dash in many cases because it does damage
