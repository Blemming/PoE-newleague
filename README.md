### Tips
	- Logging out and back in is a great way to go back to town for free (might not be worth it in first hour of league)
	- You don't need to talk to NPCs to get quests
	- One Man tag: Hit boss with everyone not in instance, port in, easy 1 man boss
	- Flesh and stone blinds mobs
	- Skitter bots slow mobs and shock(15%damage)
	- Leaving Izaro lieutenants alive gives you more keys at the end
	- At levl 50 and over, do all vaal side areas for 6-links, you can change colors in crafting bench
	- Don't obsess over every drop, prioritize sockets and links
	- 7 vaal gems + sacrifice fragment = Vaal orb, with Vaal Orbs you can vaal your skills
	- Molten shell is a very good skill to vaal for Hardcore
	- Essences are good for easy leveling crafting


## --=== Act 1 ===--
### Tips
	- Look for 3-link wands at vendor and +1 skill gem type you are using
	- Look for movement speed boots at vendor by using the search function, searching 'movement'
	- Pick up all small blues to vendor for alteration shards
	- Wait until level ~10-12 for league mechanics
	- Don't use chest armor, chest armor slow your movement speed
	- Tri-color tri-link gives you a chromatic orb when sold to vendor
	- It is worth killing blue mobs groups early, but not rare mobs as they give little value compared to the time it takes to kill
	- Frostblink is better than dash in many cases because it does damage
	- Freeing Navali give syou access to prophecies
